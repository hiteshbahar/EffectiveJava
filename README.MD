Binary Search Algorithm:

 * iterative :
   * Time Complexity: O(logn)
   * Space Complexity: O(1)
 * Recursive: 
   * Time Complexity : O(logn)
   * Space Complexity: O(logn)

When there is a space constraint, we should use iterative approach, when there is no space constraint then we should use Recursive approach.

Merge Sort Algorithm: 
   * Time Complexity: O(nLogn)
   * Space Complexity: O(n)

Insertion-sort Algorithm:  
   * Time Complexity : O(n^2)
   * Space Complexity: O(1)

Binary Search Tree:  Recursive stack approach
   * Inorder:
     * Time Complexity: o(n)
     * Space Complexity: o(N)
   * Preorder:
      * Time Complexity: o(n)
      * Space Complexity: o(N)
   * Postorder:
      * Time Complexity: o(n)
      * Space Complexity: o(N)
